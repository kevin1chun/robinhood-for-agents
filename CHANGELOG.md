# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-24

The `onboard`/`setup` commands and the `install --mcp|--skills|--mode|--agent` flags are gone, which breaks scripts that call them, so this release is a major bump.

### Added

- **One-command setup:** `bunx robinhood-for-agents install [-y]` picks from the detected agent apps, registers the server through the add-mcp library, and copies the skill with a pinned `skills` CLI (`--copy`, global). It generates `ROBINHOOD_TOKEN_KEY` or reuses the one already in an agent config, and optionally adds the `robinhood-web` entry.
- OpenClaw (when `~/.openclaw` exists): `install` copies the skill and adds `robinhood-for-agents` as a dependency in `~/.openclaw/workspace`.
- `login [--export]`: web-mode Chrome login outside an MCP client; `--export` writes `./tokens.enc` for Docker.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `onboard`/`setup` and `install --mcp|--skills|--mode|--agent` removed; use `install` and `login`. The per-agent registration code is removed.
- `install` removes the pre-4.0 `robinhood-agent` Claude Code entry.
- The standard-mode missing-key error now points to `install` instead of `openssl`.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-21

The modes were renamed and the default flipped: a server started without a flag now relays Robinhood's official hosted MCP instead of calling the web API, which changes behavior for every no-flag user, so this release is a major bump.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: modes renamed.** `agent` → `standard` (the official hosted-MCP relay, now the default with no flag), `standard` → `web` (the web API, now `--mode web` / `ROBINHOOD_MODE=web`). `--mode agent` and `ROBINHOOD_MODE=agent` exit with a hint. Client entries: `robinhood-for-agents` is now standard, `robinhood-web` is web; `robinhood-agent` is retired and `install` removes it. Parity status `agent-only` → `standard-only`.
- **README rebuilt around a reader path**, with a per-client Quick start (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Cursor, Antigravity, Hermes, other JSON clients) that registers standard mode in one command. The README `## Authentication` section is gone; its content lives in `docs/SECURITY.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **`docs/MODES.md`** is the single mode comparison, and every other doc opens with a scope banner naming its mode. The tool table's collapsed standard-only row lists all 29 tools.
- Added a Buy Me a Coffee badge and a short note from the maintainer.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-09-18

The MCP tools take the official Robinhood Trading MCP's names and input schemas (parameter names, types, enums, required set) wherever a standard-REST endpoint is evidenced. `docs/official-mcp-tools.md#parity` maps all 81 official tools (34 same, 15 renamed, 3 new, 29 agent-only); `__tests__/server/official-parity.test.ts` checks every schema against the official one in both modes. The server runs in one of two modes: standard (59 tools, web API) or agent (82 tools, relayed to Robinhood's hosted MCP). The client library stays backwards-compatible.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (MCP tools): renamed or split to the official names.** `robinhood_get_stock_quote` → `robinhood_get_equity_quotes`; `robinhood_get_fundamentals` → `robinhood_get_equity_fundamentals`; `robinhood_get_news` → `robinhood_get_equity_news` (earnings are `robinhood_get_earnings_results`); `robinhood_get_historicals` → `robinhood_get_equity_historicals` (`start_time`/`end_time` instead of `span`); `robinhood_place_stock_order` → `robinhood_place_equity_order`; `robinhood_get_orders` and `robinhood_get_order_status` → `robinhood_get_equity_orders` / `robinhood_get_crypto_orders` (option orders stay on `robinhood_get_option_orders`; status is the `order_id` filter); `robinhood_cancel_order` → `robinhood_cancel_equity_order` / `robinhood_cancel_option_order` / `robinhood_cancel_crypto_order`; `robinhood_get_options` → `robinhood_get_option_chains` / `robinhood_get_option_instruments` / `robinhood_get_option_quotes`; `robinhood_get_crypto` → `robinhood_get_crypto_quotes` / `robinhood_get_crypto_positions` / `robinhood_get_crypto_historicals` (fork-only).
- **BREAKING: order schemas are the official ones.** Prices and quantities are strings; `type` is required on equity and crypto orders, and a price the type does not take is rejected; option legs are named by `option_id`; `time_in_force` defaults to `gfd` and `market_hours` to `regular_hours` (reverses 2.0.0's required `market_hours`: the official schema makes it optional); each place tool takes an optional `ref_id` idempotency key; cancel tools require the account, and an equity or option order of another account is refused.
- **BREAKING: read-tool schemas are the official ones.** Symbols are arrays; `robinhood_get_portfolio`, `robinhood_get_equity_positions`, `robinhood_get_option_positions`, and `robinhood_get_option_orders` require `account_number` and take the official filters; `robinhood_search` takes `asset_type` and `limit`; `robinhood_get_earnings_calendar` takes `days`, `start_date`, `filter`; `robinhood_get_indexes` takes `symbols`; `robinhood_get_index_quotes` takes `instrument_ids`; `robinhood_get_equity_tradability` requires `account_number`; `robinhood_get_equity_price_book` takes up to 4 `symbols`; `robinhood_get_option_historicals` takes `instrument_ids` and a time range; the P&L tools take `timezone` / `cursor`.
- **Dropped from the tools, kept on the client:** trailing stops, the search `tag` browse, aggregate option positions, `with_dividends`.
- **In the official schema but rejected, because this API cannot serve them:** equity `dollar_amount` and `tax_lots`; option `market`/`stop_market` types and non-regular sessions; crypto stop types; `adjustment_type` other than `split`; fundamentals and option-historicals `bounds` other than `regular`.

### Added

- `robinhood_get_equity_technical_indicators` (18 indicators, computed by this server over the REST bars: `src/compute/indicators.ts`), `robinhood_get_currency_pairs`, and `robinhood_preview_crypto_order` (read-only estimate at the live quote).
- **Agent mode** (`--mode agent` or `ROBINHOOD_MODE=agent`; default `standard`): the 81 official tools, each relayed to Robinhood's hosted MCP (`agent.robinhood.com`) under a separate credential from `robinhood_official_login`; orders reach the Agentic account only. The Parity status `agent-only` marks the 29 official tools with no web endpoint (advanced orders, option exercise, alerts, scanner writes and datapoints, onboarding and upgrade info, financials, analyst ratings, SEC filings, politician trades, index historicals), which exist only in agent mode. `install --mode agent` registers it as a second entry, `robinhood-agent`; `onboard` asks for the mode.
- Agent-mode relay of the 52 tools that were REST-served is offline-tested only; live check pending.
- Client: `getOptionChains({ ids?, underlyingSymbol? })`, `getOptionInstruments({ chainId, ... })`, `getOptionQuotes(ids)`, `getOptionHistoricalsById(id, opts)`, `getIndexValues(ids)`; a `refId` option on `orderStock` / `orderOption` / `orderCrypto`; `optionId` legs on `orderOption` and `reviewOptionOrder`.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-27

`robinhood_place_stock_order` gains a required parameter and drops `extended_hours`, which breaks existing callers of that tool, so this release is a major bump. The **client library** API remains backwards-compatible: `extendedHours` still works and `marketHours` is optional there.

### Added

- **24 Hour Market / explicit trading session** — `orderStock()` gained `marketHours` (`"regular_hours" | "extended_hours" | "all_day_hours"`, exported as the `OrderMarketHours` type). `all_day_hours` is Robinhood's overnight 24 Hour Market, previously unreachable. It supersedes the legacy `extendedHours` boolean — on the wire `extended_hours` is simply `market_hours !== "regular_hours"`, so the boolean is derived from it and a contradictory pair throws instead of silently picking one.

- **`robinhood_get_market_hours` / `getMarketHours()`** — market hours for a date: whether it is a trading day, and when the regular and extended sessions open and close. Added because `robinhood_place_stock_order` now requires an explicit session: an agent needs a way to *find out* which one is live rather than inferring it from a local clock that is wrong across time zones, weekends, and holidays. Defaults to today in market time (ET), not the caller's local date. Brings the tool count to 50.
- **`examples/short-selling.ts`** — a runnable, commented walkthrough of the full flow (market-hours check → margin check → shortability check → review → short → cover). Dry-run by default; `--place` is required to submit anything, and `--session=` selects the trading session.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (MCP tool):** `robinhood_place_stock_order` replaces the optional `extended_hours` boolean (default `false`) with a **required** `market_hours` enum. There is deliberately no default: an order tagged to the wrong session silently queues for the next open instead of executing, and a caller that passes only the old `extended_hours` now fails loudly on the missing parameter rather than quietly placing a regular-hours order. The client library keeps `extendedHours` working, so programmatic callers are unaffected.

### Fixed

- **Short selling** ([#26](https://github.com/kevin1chun/robinhood-for-agents/issues/26)) — `side` now accepts `"sell_short"` in `orderStock()`, `reviewEquityOrder()`, `robinhood_place_stock_order`, and `robinhood_review_equity_order`. Robinhood models a short as its own side value paired with `position_effect: "open"`, not as a plain `sell`: a `sell` with no shares to deliver was rejected with `Not enough shares to sell.`, and either field without the other returns `This type of trade is invalid.` Both are now sent together, along with an explicit `market_hours` (short sales are session-scoped — outside regular hours the API demands the session be named, so pass `marketHours: "extended_hours"` on the client or `market_hours: "extended_hours"` on the tool). `order_form_type` is derived server-side and deliberately not sent. The client library's default payload for an ordinary `buy`/`sell` is unchanged when `marketHours` is omitted; note that the MCP tool now always sends `market_hours`, since it is required there. Shorting requires a margin-enabled account — a cash account is rejected upstream with `You need to have margin investing enabled to short.` Fractional short sales are rejected client-side. There is no separate cover side (`buy_to_cover` is not a valid choice); close a short with an ordinary `buy`, which Robinhood stamps `position_effect: "close"` itself. Verified end to end with a live open-and-cover round trip.

- **Order writes resolve symbols by exact match.** `orderStock()` used `findInstruments()[0]` — the first hit of a fuzzy `?query=` search, which can be a same-prefix or relisted/OTC duplicate ticker. It now uses `resolveInstrumentBySymbol()`, the same exact-match resolver `reviewEquityOrder()` already used, so a review and the order it authorises can no longer resolve to different securities and an ambiguous ticker is refused rather than guessed. This was pre-existing, but `sell_short` removes the `Not enough shares to sell.` backstop that made a wrong instrument survivable.
- **Non-limit orders are rejected client-side when tagged to a non-regular session.** Only limit orders execute in `extended_hours` / `all_day_hours`; market, stop, and trailing-stop orders now fail fast with the reason instead of an opaque API rejection. Scoped to an explicit `marketHours`, so a legacy `extendedHours` caller is unaffected.
- **Short-sale constraints reproduced client-side.** Live testing surfaced two the API enforces and this library did not: shorts are rejected in the 24 Hour Market (`Short selling isn't available during the 24 Hour Market.`) and must be good-for-day (`Short sell orders must be good for day only.`). Both now fail fast with the reason, and the docs no longer suggest `all_day_hours` as a valid session for a short.
- **`reviewEquityOrder()` enforces what the place step enforces** — fractional short sales and non-positive limit/stop prices are now rejected at review, instead of returning a clean-looking preview of an order that cannot be placed.

### Documentation

- **Skill-doc audit for agent readability.** Everything learned from live testing is now stated where an agent will actually read it, in all three progressive-disclosure layers. Newly documented: the order-`state` vocabulary — including `locate_completed`, the state an accepted short returns, which was previously undocumented and reads like a failure; that a filled short appears as a **negative** position quantity and is closed by buying, not selling (`portfolio.md` had no mention of shorts at all); and that Robinhood returns one rejection at a time, checking the session before the account type, so a rejection can hide another behind it. Constraint tables now say whether each rejection comes from this library or from Robinhood, and quote the message the caller will actually see.
- **`__tests__/client/doc-accuracy.test.ts`** pins the guard messages to the docs that quote them, so a reworded guard fails CI instead of silently invalidating the skill an agent is following.

- Short selling and trading sessions documented across the README (new **Placing Orders** section with side and session tables), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (side resolution and session wire format, plus the rationale for the required `market_hours`), `docs/ACCESS_CONTROLS.md` (short sales in the high-risk tier), `docs/USE_CASES.md`, `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` (examples conventions and an unbounded-risk item on the safety checklist), and all three skill layers (`SKILL.md` safety rules, `trade.md` flow, `reference.md` tool parameters, `client-api.md` method reference).
- `examples/` is now covered by `bun run check`; the pre-existing `gateway-auth` example was brought up to the same lint standard (its tests still pass, 30/30).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Proactive token renewal** — `TokenData` gained an optional `expires_at` (unix seconds) and a new exported `deriveExpiresAt(accessToken, {expiresIn, issuedAt})` helper that prefers the JWT `exp` claim and falls back to `issuedAt + expires_in`. `RobinhoodSession.ensureFreshToken` is a new pre-request hook that renews the access token 24h before expiry (`REFRESH_SKEW_SEC`) instead of waiting for a 401 — refresh tokens are single-use and rotate on every grant, so it is the chain lapsing while the client is idle, not the access token expiring, that forces a browser re-login. `restoreSession()` backfills `expires_at` for entries persisted before the field existed, so existing logins get proactive renewal without re-authenticating; the field is optional purely for that back-compat.
- **Cross-process token adoption** — when a refresh POST is rejected, `adoptFromStore()` re-reads the `TokenStore` and adopts a token another process may have already persisted, rather than failing while a valid credential sits in the store. Robinhood enforces single-use refresh-token rotation with no cross-process lock available, so two clients refreshing concurrently poison the loser; this makes that recoverable, but a single writer per store is still the supported configuration.

### Changed

- **`robinhood_check_session` now probes the API** instead of reporting `logged_in` whenever tokens merely exist. Returns `logged_in` (probe succeeded), `expired` (tokens dead and unrefreshable, with re-login instructions), `unknown` (transient/network failure — deliberately not claimed as expired), or `not_authenticated`.
- **A 401 surviving the refresh retry raises `TokenExpiredError`** (existing `AuthenticationError` subclass, now actually used) telling the caller to re-authenticate with browser login, instead of a bare `APIError: HTTP 401` that gave no indication a re-login was needed.
- **Refresh-token save failures are no longer silently swallowed** — they log a `CRITICAL` message to stderr. Under enforced rotation the attempted token is already dead, so a lost save leaves the only copy of the new refresh token in memory and strands the next process start.
- Documentation corrected throughout: access-token lifetime is **variable** (~6–8.5 days observed), not a fixed ~8.5 days, and refresh is no longer described as 401-only. `docs/DOCKER.md` gains a single-writer warning and a container re-authentication runbook.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- **Documentation accuracy pass** — `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` rebuilt around the shipped surface (49 tools, was stale at 18; Zod v4; all four API hosts; complete file map); root `SECURITY.md` corrected (supported versions, ~8.5-day token lifetime, keychain-default storage); `robinhood_get_crypto` and `robinhood_get_movers` parameter docs and the `orderCrypto` signature corrected in the skill, and the MCP↔client mapping table completed; `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated to Zod v4 idioms, real test-mock paths, and the unified-skill layout; stale per-domain skill names replaced in `ACCESS_CONTROLS.md`; `SKILL.md` no longer claims Brave/Chromium/`BROWSER_PATH` support (login is Chrome-only)
- **Gateway auth example** — `docker-compose.yml` no longer builds a nonexistent root Dockerfile; the upstream `mcp` service is an explicit placeholder and `docs/GATEWAY-AUTH.md` now states the gateway needs an HTTP-reachable MCP upstream (the bundled MCP server is stdio-only)
- **Changelog** — added the missing 0.7.0/0.7.1 entries (including the 0.7.0 removal of 0.6.2's multi-browser login) and compare links for 1.0.0/0.8.0/0.7.2; corrected the 1.0.0 note that misstated browser support
- README manual setup now registers the npm package via `bunx robinhood-for-agents` (with from-source variants); Bun prerequisite corrected to v1.3+ to match `engines`

### Changed

- npm package now ships `docs/` so README links resolve in the installed tarball
- LICENSE copyright year updated to 2025-2026

### Removed

- Internal planning documents (`docs/superpowers/`, `docs/official-mcp-parity.md`) and the external-tool walkthrough section of `docs/USE_CASES.md`

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Equity tax lots** — `getEquityTaxLots(symbol, {accountNumber})` client method + `robinhood_get_equity_tax_lots` MCP tool (`GET /tax_lots/open/{account}/{instrument}/`, standard-token readable). Returns the open tax lots for one holding — quantity, book/tax cost basis, acquisition date, long/short-term status, `open_lot_id`. New `TaxLot` type + schema. Symbol resolved by exact match; per-lot `account_number` scrubbed (only the caller-supplied one is echoed); results are complete (no account-encoding pagination cursor is surfaced).
- **Curated-list follow/unfollow** — `robinhood_follow_watchlist` / `robinhood_unfollow_watchlist` (+ `followWatchlist`/`unfollowWatchlist` client methods). `POST`/`DELETE /discovery/lists/{list_id}/followers/{user_id}/`; the caller's own profile id is resolved internally (never a param), cached per session, and structurally redacted from any error text. Results are declarative (`{list_id, followed}`).
- **Options-watchlist contract writes** — `robinhood_add_option_to_watchlist` / `robinhood_remove_option_from_watchlist` (+ `quickAddOption`, `getOptionWatchlistContracts`, `getOptionInstrumentById` client methods). Add mints single-leg contracts via `quick_add` (deduped against current contents so it stays idempotent); remove matches by exact `strategy_code` and deletes via the midlands bulk-delete primitive. `position_type` accepts `"long"` only over this path (short-leg entries are directed to the app).

### Changed

- **`robinhood_get_option_watchlist` now returns the contracts** on the options watchlist (each with its `object_id`, derived `option_id`, and `position_type`), rather than just the list metadata — matching the official Trading MCP tool. It reads with `load_all_attributes=false` (the options list rejects the server default). Multi-leg strategies are listed with a null `option_id` and directed to the app.
- **MCP tool layer modernized** — all 49 tools migrated from the legacy `server.tool()` API to `registerTool` with human-readable `title`s, full annotation coverage (`readOnlyHint: true` on every read; explicit `destructiveHint`/`idempotentHint` on order placement, cancel, and login — previously only the Tier-2 write tools carried annotations), and structured output (`outputSchema` + `structuredContent`). Structured content passes through the same redaction as the text block (built by re-parsing the redacted JSON, so the two can never drift). Output schemas type only handler-constructed envelope keys and stay deliberately loose on API-passthrough data, so upstream schema drift can't become a runtime tool failure. New end-to-end tests run the tools through the real MCP SDK over an in-memory transport (which caught a `z.record()` top-level schema the SDK silently drops — replaced with `z.looseObject({})`).
- **Overlapping tool descriptions disambiguated** — `robinhood_get_stock_quote` vs `robinhood_get_fundamentals` and `robinhood_get_orders` vs `robinhood_get_option_orders` now each state when to prefer the other.
- **Skill + docs accuracy pass** — new client-first `watchlists.md` domain file (extracted from SKILL.md); SKILL.md slimmed by folding its method-inventory table into `client-api.md`, which also gained missing methods and dropped a documented-but-nonexistent `getOpenOptionPositions` (real methods: `getOptionPositions` / `getOptionAggregatePositions`); fixed the stale "~24h token" claim across skill files (access tokens last ~8.5 days with auto-refresh) and aligned browser-support docs with the shipped Chrome-only login (the 0.6.2 multi-browser auto-detection was removed in 0.7.0); skill `allowed-tools` now pre-approves the primary `bun` execution path; CLAUDE.md counts corrected (49 tools, 76 client methods).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Short-interest API** — `getShortInterest(symbol, opts?)` client method + `robinhood_get_short_interest` MCP tool. Returns Robinhood's modeled daily short-interest series (`shares_short` and `pc_freefloat`, each with upper/lower confidence bounds) — a modeled estimate, **not** the official biweekly FINRA settlement figure. The endpoint caps each request at a 92-day window; the client transparently walks backward in ≤90-day chunks and merges them, so callers get the full available series (RH's history begins ~mid-2025) in one call. New `ShortInterest` / `ShortInterestDaily` types + schemas.
- **Fundamentals MCP tool** — `robinhood_get_fundamentals` surfaces the existing `getFundamentals()` data (float, shares outstanding, market cap, P/E, P/B, dividend schedule, 52-week range, company profile) as a standalone tool, without the live quote that `robinhood_get_stock_quote` bundles.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Schema accuracy pass** — every Zod schema returned by a `RobinhoodClient` method was diffed against a live API response and widened to match (`FundamentalSchema`, `QuoteSchema`, `EarningsSchema`, and 14 others). Type-only change: the client casts rather than parses, so this is zero runtime behavior change (#21)

### Added

- Gateway auth example, a follow-up to `AGENT-IDENTITY.md` (#20)

### Changed

- Updated skill docs (`client-api.md`, `research.md`, `options.md`, `reference.md`, `SKILL.md`) to surface the newly-typed fields from the schema accuracy pass; corrected a stale claim in `CLAUDE.md`/`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` that Zod runtime-validates API responses — it only types them (client casts, not parses) and separately validates MCP tool-call parameters (#22)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- **Package runtime entrypoints** — `main`/`bin`/`exports` now point at built `dist/` outputs so the published npm package runs without the TypeScript sources (#16)
- Stop redacting `account_number` from tool output — it is required input for account-scoped tools in multi-account setups (#14, #18)

### Added

- `docs/AGENT-IDENTITY.md` — agent identity verification and per-tool authorization guide for multi-agent deployments (#17)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- **TokenStore auth architecture** — pluggable `TokenStore` adapters (`KeychainTokenStore` default, `EncryptedFileTokenStore` for Docker/headless with `ROBINHOOD_TOKENS_FILE` + `ROBINHOOD_TOKEN_KEY`), direct Bearer injection, and security hardening across the auth path (#8)
- OpenClaw onboarding installs `robinhood-for-agents` as a workspace dependency so the skill's `bun` imports resolve (#8)

### Removed

- **Multi-browser login support from 0.6.2** — Brave/Chromium auto-detection and the `BROWSER_PATH` override were removed in the auth refactor; browser login is Google Chrome only (`playwright-core` `channel: "chrome"`)

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Chrome-based browser support** — browser login now auto-detects Brave, Chrome, and Chromium on macOS; accepts custom `executablePath` via `BROWSER_PATH` env or `robinhood_browser_login` tool parameter (#4)
- **Claude Code GitHub Workflow** for CI (#6)

### Fixed

- Use `claude_args` instead of invalid `model` input for Opus 4.6 CLI integration
- Remove unused import and fix import ordering in token-store test

### Changed

- Browser auth refactored with shared `getAccountHint` helper in `_helpers.ts`
- Updated skill setup docs to reflect multi-browser support

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **Keychain-only token storage** — removed plaintext session fallback; tokens are stored exclusively in OS keychain via `Bun.secrets`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- **Unified skill** — merged 5 separate skills (setup, portfolio, research, trade, options) into one dual-mode skill with three-layer progressive disclosure (SKILL.md → reference.md → client-api.md)

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- Option chain ID parameter handling

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- **Renamed package** from `rh-for-agents` to `robinhood-for-agents`
- Updated README with auth flow diagrams and security documentation

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Multi-leg option spreads** — unified `orderOption()` method and `robinhood_place_option_order` MCP tool now support single-leg and multi-leg orders (verticals, iron condors, straddles, butterflies) via a `legs` array
- **Stop-limit option orders** — new `stop_price` parameter triggers stop-limit behavior on option orders
- **Fractional share guardrails** — fractional stock orders auto-enforce `gfd` time-in-force and reject non-market order types with clear error messages
- **Idempotent orders** — all order types (stock, option, crypto) now include `ref_id` (UUID) for idempotency, matching Robinhood's expected payload format

### Fixed

- **Option order 500 errors** — added missing `ref_id` and `override_dtbp_checks` fields to option order payload; changed default `time_in_force` from `gtc` to `gfd`
- **Crypto dollar-amount + limit price conflict** — when using `amountIn: "price"` with `limitPrice`, the client now correctly derives quantity instead of sending conflicting `price` fields

### Changed

- **Unified option order API** — merged separate single-leg and spread methods into one `orderOption(symbol, legs, price, quantity, direction, opts?)` signature; `direction` is now required
- **Token storage** — migrated from AES-256-GCM file encryption to OS keychain via `Bun.secrets` (zero deps, no files on disk)
- Updated all skill docs (options, trade) to reflect new legs-based option order API
- `StockOrder` type now captures `trailing_peg` and `ref_id`; `OptionOrder` captures `trigger`, `stop_price`, `strategy`, `ref_id`

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **Token refresh flow** using `refresh_token` + `device_token` with `expires_in: 734000` (~8.5 days, matching pyrh). Sessions last significantly longer before requiring browser re-login.
- Detailed encrypt/decrypt flow diagrams in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Authentication section in `CLAUDE.md` documenting browser auth mechanism

### Fixed

- **device_token capture** in browser login — Robinhood's frontend sends OAuth requests as JSON, not form-urlencoded. The interceptor now parses JSON first, correctly capturing `device_token`.
- **Release workflow** — added `setup-node` with `registry-url` for npm authentication

### Changed

- README prerequisites clarified: Google Chrome is required by `playwright-core` (no bundled browser)
- Removed `robin_stocks` migration context from `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Removed OpenClaw MCP bridge references from README

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- **MCP Server** with 18 structured tools for any MCP-compatible AI agent
- **Standalone client library** (`robinhood-for-agents`) with ~50 async methods
- **5 Claude Code skills**: setup, portfolio, research, trade, options
- Browser-based authentication via Playwright (Chrome)
- AES-256-GCM encrypted session storage with OS keychain key management
- Multi-account support (first-class across all account-scoped methods)
- Interactive onboarding TUI (`robinhood-for-agents onboard`)
- One-command install for Claude Code (`robinhood-for-agents install`)
- Safety controls: blocked fund transfers, blocked bulk cancels, explicit order parameters
- Support for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenClaw agents
