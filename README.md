AI-native Robinhood trading interface — TypeScript monorepo with a standalone API client and MCP server.

Two packages:
- **`@rh-agent-tools/client`** — Standalone Robinhood API client (~50 async methods)
- **`rh-agent-tools`** — MCP server with 18 structured tools for any MCP-compatible AI agent

Compatible with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenClaw**, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+
- Google Chrome
- A Robinhood account

## Quick Start (local install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin1chun/rh-agent-tools.git
cd rh-agent-tools
bun install
```

### 1. Install MCP server + skills

```bash
bun packages/server/bin/rh-agent-tools.ts install
```

This does two things:
- Adds the MCP server to `~/.claude/settings.json` (global — available in all projects)
- Copies 5 skills to `.claude/skills/` in the current directory

Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes.

You can also install them separately:

```bash
bun packages/server/bin/rh-agent-tools.ts install --mcp     # MCP server config only
bun packages/server/bin/rh-agent-tools.ts install --skills   # Skills only
```

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (Claude Desktop or other MCP clients)</summary>

Add to your MCP client's config (e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rh-agent-tools": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/absolute/path/to/rh-agent-tools/packages/server/bin/rh-agent-tools.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### 2. Authenticate

Start Claude Code and say "setup robinhood" (or call `robinhood_browser_login` directly). Chrome will open to the real Robinhood login page — log in with your credentials and MFA. The session is cached and auto-restores for ~24 hours.

## Quick Start (npm — IN PROGRESS)

Once published to npm, the setup simplifies to:

```bash
npm install -g rh-agent-tools

# Install MCP server config + skills (same as local, but no bun prefix needed)
cd your-project
rh-agent-tools install
```

## Client Library (standalone)

```typescript
import { RobinhoodClient } from "@rh-agent-tools/client";

const client = new RobinhoodClient();
await client.restoreSession();

const quotes = await client.getQuotes("AAPL");
const portfolio = await client.buildHoldings();
```

## MCP Tools (18)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `robinhood_browser_login` | Authenticate via Chrome browser |
| `robinhood_check_session` | Check if cached session is valid |
| `robinhood_get_portfolio` | Portfolio: positions, P&L, equity, cash |
| `robinhood_get_accounts` | List all brokerage accounts |
| `robinhood_get_account` | Account details and profile |
| `robinhood_get_stock_quote` | Stock quotes and fundamentals |
| `robinhood_get_historicals` | OHLCV price history |
| `robinhood_get_news` | News, analyst ratings, earnings |
| `robinhood_get_movers` | Market movers and popular stocks |
| `robinhood_get_options` | Options chain with greeks |
| `robinhood_get_crypto` | Crypto quotes, history, positions |
| `robinhood_place_stock_order` | Place stock orders (market/limit/stop/trailing) |
| `robinhood_place_option_order` | Place option orders |
| `robinhood_place_crypto_order` | Place crypto orders |
| `robinhood_get_orders` | View order history |
| `robinhood_cancel_order` | Cancel an order by ID |
| `robinhood_get_order_status` | Get status of a specific order by ID |
| `robinhood_search` | Search stocks or browse categories |

## Claude Code Skills (5)

Install skills into any project (see [Quick Start](#quick-start-local-install) for full setup).

| Skill | Triggers |
|-------|----------|
| `robinhood-setup` | "setup robinhood", "connect to robinhood" |
| `robinhood-portfolio` | "show my portfolio", "my holdings" |
| `robinhood-research` | "research AAPL", "analyze TSLA" |
| `robinhood-trade` | "buy 10 AAPL", "sell my position" |
| `robinhood-options` | "show AAPL options", "find calls" |

Each skill includes a `client-api.md` reference for advanced users who want Claude to generate TypeScript scripts using `@rh-agent-tools/client`.

## Safety

- Fund transfers and bank operations are **blocked** — never exposed
- Bulk cancel operations are **blocked**
- All order placements require explicit parameters (no dangerous defaults)
- Skills always confirm with the user before placing orders
- See [ACCESS_CONTROLS.md](docs/ACCESS_CONTROLS.md) for the full risk matrix

## Authentication

Sessions are cached to `~/.rh-agent-tools/session.enc` (AES-256-GCM encrypted, key in OS keychain). Authentication uses browser-based login — `robinhood_browser_login` opens Chrome to the real Robinhood login page where you handle MFA natively. After initial login, subsequent authentication is automatic until the token expires (~24 hours).

**MCP**: Call `robinhood_browser_login` to open Chrome and log in. After that, all tools auto-restore the cached session.

**Skills**: Run the `robinhood-setup` skill for guided browser login.

## Development

```bash
bun install                    # Install deps
bun run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
bun run check                  # Biome lint + format
npx vitest run                 # Run all tests (120 tests)
```
