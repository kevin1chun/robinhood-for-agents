Robinhood for AI agents — TypeScript monorepo with a standalone API client and MCP server.

Two packages:
- **`@rh-for-agents/client`** — Standalone Robinhood API client (~50 async methods)
- **`rh-for-agents`** — MCP server with 18 structured tools for any MCP-compatible AI agent

Compatible with **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **OpenClaw**, and any MCP-compatible agent.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.0+
- Google Chrome (used by `playwright-core` for browser-based login — no bundled browser)
- A Robinhood account

## Quick Start

### Guided setup (recommended)

```bash
# Requires Bun runtime — see Prerequisites
npx rh-for-agents onboard
```

The interactive setup detects your agent, registers the MCP server, installs skills (where supported), and walks you through Robinhood login.

You can also specify your agent directly:

```bash
rh-for-agents onboard --agent claude-code
rh-for-agents onboard --agent codex
rh-for-agents onboard --agent openclaw
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevin1chun/rh-for-agents.git
cd rh-for-agents
bun install
bun packages/server/bin/rh-for-agents.ts onboard
```

### Manual setup

<details>
<summary>Claude Code</summary>

```bash
# Register MCP server (global — available in all projects)
claude mcp add -s user rh-for-agents -- bun run /path/to/packages/server/bin/rh-for-agents.ts

# Install skills (per-project, optional)
cd your-project
rh-for-agents install --skills
```

Restart Claude Code to pick up the changes. Claude Code supports 5 trading skills in addition to the 18 MCP tools — see [Skills](#skills-5).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Codex</summary>

```bash
codex mcp add rh-for-agents -- bun run /path/to/packages/server/bin/rh-for-agents.ts
```

Restart Codex to pick up the changes. Codex uses all 18 MCP tools directly.
</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenClaw (skills only)</summary>

```bash
rh-for-agents onboard --agent openclaw
```

This installs 5 trading skills to `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`. Restart the OpenClaw gateway to pick up the changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Other MCP clients (Claude Desktop, etc.)</summary>

Add to your MCP client's config (e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` for Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rh-for-agents": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "/absolute/path/to/rh-for-agents/packages/server/bin/rh-for-agents.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

## Authenticate

Start your agent and say "setup robinhood" (or call `robinhood_browser_login` directly). Chrome will open to the real Robinhood login page — log in with your credentials and MFA. The session is cached and auto-restores for ~24 hours.

## MCP Tools (18)

All 18 tools work with every MCP-compatible agent.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `robinhood_browser_login` | Authenticate via Chrome browser |
| `robinhood_check_session` | Check if cached session is valid |
| `robinhood_get_portfolio` | Portfolio: positions, P&L, equity, cash |
| `robinhood_get_accounts` | List all brokerage accounts |
| `robinhood_get_account` | Account details and profile |
| `robinhood_get_stock_quote` | Stock quotes and fundamentals |
| `robinhood_get_historicals` | OHLCV price history |
| `robinhood_get_news` | News, analyst ratings, earnings |
| `robinhood_get_movers` | Market movers and popular stocks |
| `robinhood_get_options` | Options chain with greeks |
| `robinhood_get_crypto` | Crypto quotes, history, positions |
| `robinhood_place_stock_order` | Place stock orders (market/limit/stop/trailing) |
| `robinhood_place_option_order` | Place option orders |
| `robinhood_place_crypto_order` | Place crypto orders |
| `robinhood_get_orders` | View order history |
| `robinhood_cancel_order` | Cancel an order by ID |
| `robinhood_get_order_status` | Get status of a specific order by ID |
| `robinhood_search` | Search stocks or browse categories |

## Skills (5)

Skills provide guided workflows on top of MCP tools. Supported by **Claude Code** and **OpenClaw**. Agents without skill support (Codex, etc.) use the 18 MCP tools directly, which provide the same functionality.

| Skill | Triggers |
|-------|----------|
| `robinhood-setup` | "setup robinhood", "connect to robinhood" |
| `robinhood-portfolio` | "show my portfolio", "my holdings" |
| `robinhood-research` | "research AAPL", "analyze TSLA" |
| `robinhood-trade` | "buy 10 AAPL", "sell my position" |
| `robinhood-options` | "show AAPL options", "find calls" |

Each skill includes a `client-api.md` reference for advanced users who want their agent to generate TypeScript scripts using `@rh-for-agents/client`.

## Agent Compatibility

| Feature | Claude Code | Codex | OpenClaw | Other MCP |
|---------|:-----------:|:-----:|:--------:|:---------:|
| 18 MCP tools | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 5 trading skills | Yes | — | Yes | — |
| `onboard` setup | Yes | Yes | Yes | — |
| Browser auth | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Client Library (standalone)

```typescript
import { RobinhoodClient } from "@rh-for-agents/client";

const client = new RobinhoodClient();
await client.restoreSession();

const quotes = await client.getQuotes("AAPL");
const portfolio = await client.buildHoldings();
```

## Safety

- Fund transfers and bank operations are **blocked** — never exposed
- Bulk cancel operations are **blocked**
- All order placements require explicit parameters (no dangerous defaults)
- Skills always confirm with the user before placing orders
- See [ACCESS_CONTROLS.md](docs/ACCESS_CONTROLS.md) for the full risk matrix

## Authentication

Sessions are cached to `~/.rh-for-agents/session.enc` (AES-256-GCM encrypted, key in OS keychain). Authentication uses browser-based login — `robinhood_browser_login` opens Chrome to the real Robinhood login page where you handle MFA natively. After initial login, subsequent authentication is automatic until the token expires (~24 hours).

**MCP**: Call `robinhood_browser_login` to open Chrome and log in (works with all agents). After that, all tools auto-restore the cached session.

**Skills**: Run the `robinhood-setup` skill for guided browser login (Claude Code and OpenClaw).

## Development

```bash
bun install                    # Install deps
bun run typecheck              # tsc --noEmit
bun run check                  # Biome lint + format
npx vitest run                 # Run all tests
```
