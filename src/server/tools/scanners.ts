/**
 * Scanner (screener) read tools for Robinhood.
 *
 * Both tools are read-only. They mirror the official Robinhood Trading MCP's
 * `get_scanner_filter_specs` and `get_scans`, reimplemented over the web
 * surface with two deliberate, documented fidelity notes:
 *
 *  - `get_scanner_filter_specs` is served from an EMBEDDED static catalog
 *    captured verbatim from the official tool (the live Beacon filter-spec
 *    route isn't reachable with a web-session token, and its raw wire shape
 *    differs from the DTO). Provenance is reported in the tool result's `note`
 *    and the description — never inside the spec objects, which stay byte-parity
 *    with the official DTO. See `src/client/scanner-filter-specs.ts`.
 *
 *  - `get_scans` passes through the live Beacon read but can only faithfully
 *    derive `scan_id`/`title`/`column_count`. The official DTO's
 *    `filter_summary` (filter i18n render), `cortex_managed` (a derived flag),
 *    and `sorting` (a human-readable column label) are produced MCP-side and
 *    are NOT reproduced — they are returned as `null`, with the complete raw
 *    Beacon object preserved under `raw` so nothing is hidden or fabricated.
 *
 * Scanner WRITES (create_scan / run_scan / update_scan_*) are Phase 4 and are
 * intentionally not implemented here.
