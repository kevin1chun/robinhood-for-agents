/**
 * Equity tax-lot tool — `robinhood_get_equity_tax_lots`. Mirrors the official
 * Robinhood Trading MCP tool of the same name over web REST
 * (`GET /tax_lots/open/{account}/{instrument}/`, web-session-token readable).
 *
 * Fidelity / safety:
 *  - The symbol is resolved by EXACT match (a fuzzy first-hit would silently
 *    return the wrong security's lots for the account — the lookup keys account
 *    data, so the "tolerant on reads" clause does not apply here).
 *  - Each lot echoes an `account_number`; that key is scrubbed from the lot
 *    bodies and the single caller-SUPPLIED account_number is echoed once at the
 *    envelope, matching the project-wide account-identifier rule.
 *  - Results are COMPLETE (all pages collected). We never surface a pagination
 *    cursor: a tax-lots `next` URL embeds the account number in its path, so
 *    `next_cursor` is always null and `cursor` is accepted only for API parity.
